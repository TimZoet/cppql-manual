\code{cppql} is a thin C++ wrapper around the sqlite C API. It contains several classes to manage the lifetimes of database connections (see Section~\ref{section:database}) and statements (see Section~\ref{section:statements}). A database keeps track of the tables it contains (see Section~\ref{section:tables}). Whenever possible, invalid operations return sqlite error codes instead of throwing C++ exceptions (see Section~\ref{section:errors}).
% TODO: Reference utilities.

cppql does not wrap every single C function. You might therefore find yourself having to use the internal handles to call a C function that is not supported by the C++ layer. It also does not do e.g. exhaustive type checking when constructing queries.
