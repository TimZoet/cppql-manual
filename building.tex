cppql requires a compiler that supports C++20. It has been tested on Windows 10 and Ubuntu 20.04 with MSVC ? and GCC 11.

\subsection{Getting The Code}
\label{section:build:get}

\gls{cppql} can be cloned from GitHub. Note that since the repository contains submodules, you have to pass an additional parameter. See Listing~\ref{lst:build:clone}.

\subsection{Configuration}
\label{section:build:config}

There are several CMake configuration variables. Below an overview.

\code{CPPQL\_BIND\_ZERO\_BASED\_INDICES} can be set to \code{ON} or \code{OFF}. When enabled, the various \code{bind} methods this library provides as wrappers around the C functions become 0-based. Note that this of course does not apply to any of the C functions, should you still use those.

\code{BUILD\_TESTS} can be set to \code{ON} or \code{OFF}. When enabled, an application containing tests is created. See \ref{section:build:tests} for more information.

\subsection{Windows}

\subsection{Linux}

% Need to install libsqlite3-dev

\subsection{Running Tests}
\label{section:build:tests}

When \code{BUILD\_TESTS} is enabled, an application called \code{cppql\_test} is created (as well as some other targets the application depends on). Building this application requires \code{CPPQL\_BIND\_ZERO\_BASED\_INDICES} to be enabled as well. In order to run all tests, just run the application without any parameters. If \gls{cppql} was built successfully, they should all run without issue. The tests are written using the BetterTest~\cite{bettertest} library.
